# Heart Disease Risk Prediction System

An emergency decision support system that predicts heart disease risk using machine learning.
The system estimates the probability of heart disease and provides rule-based medical explanations through an interactive graphical user interface (GUI).

## Project Features
![Graph](assets/gui.png)
- Logistic Regression model for heart disease classification
- Probability-based risk prediction
- Risk level categorization (Low / Medium / High)
- Rule-based medical explanations
- Interactive GUI built with Tkinter
- Data preprocessing using Scikit-learn Pipeline

---

## Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression
- **Preprocessing:** StandardScaler
- **Pipeline:** Scaler + Classifier
- **Output:**
  - Probability of heart disease
  - Binary classification (0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease)

---

## Input Features
The model uses the following patient parameters:
- Age
- Sex (Male = 1, Female = 0)
- Blood Pressure (BP)
- Maximum Heart Rate
- ST Depression (ECG)
- Blood Glucose Level

---

## Risk Interpretation
Based on the predicted probability:
- **Low Risk:** < 30%
- **Medium Risk:** 30% – 60%
- **High Risk:** > 60%

---

## Explainability
![Graph](assets/data_base.png)
The system provides human-readable explanations based on medical rules, such as:
- High blood pressure
- Elevated blood glucose
- Abnormal heart rate
- Abnormal ST depression (ECG)

This improves transparency and trust in the model predictions.

---

## Graphical User Interface
- Built using **Tkinter**
- Simple and intuitive input form
- Instant prediction with probability and explanation

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Tkinter

---
